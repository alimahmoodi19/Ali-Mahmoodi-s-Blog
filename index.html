       <h2> Unit 1, Outcome 1</h2>

        <p>1.0 Before I moved to England I used to work in computer fields, mostly hardwares and repairing PC. When I moved here, I studied Computer Networking(Cisco CCNA,Level 3)In Manchester College but because of my immigration state I couldn’t continue my study or even work in that field. When I saw an advertisement about Code Nation and job opportunities here I decided to come along and try myself to learn new skills as always been interested in. The subjects are teaching here all up to date and in demand these days as tech technology moving fast.

        1.1  IT has become essential and integral part of every modern business plan. From multi national firms who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays a role. The reasons for the wide use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the business world.
        1.3 Building a website without a plan is like constructing a building without layouts. Things end up in the wrong place, features are overlooked, and the situation is ripe for miscommunication between website builder and client. Planning your website ahead of time will give it clear direction as well as prevent missed deadlines and backtracking.
This guide would help for planning the website in a best possible way:
 
Set a purpose and goals:
It’s important to identify your website’s purpose, as well as your target audience. You should also define your goals. How many visitors do you expect per month? How many do you expect will sign up for your newsletter? How much in sales do you expect to make? Set measurable, specific goals for your website that are in line with your marketing goals. An analytics tool like Google Analytics will allow you to monitor your website’s performance over time.

Set a budget:

 Whether you’re an established, mid-sized organization or a fledgling start-up, you should always set a budget for your website expenses. This will probably include funds for web design, programming, and web hosting (though other expenses may apply). Research the market by shopping around and consulting with professionals. Don’t sell yourself short by comparing prices alone. What you save in money you may later pay for with a lackluster site and lots of headaches. It’s better to choose team members based on experience, insightfulness, references, and examples of work.

Allocate rules:

Owner, marketing manager, or whoever else represents a primary function of the business,Web developer,Content writer and/or editor,HTML/CSS professional and Web and graphic designer.Make sure everyone on your team knows their role and what is expected of them, and that they stay abreast of deadlines and new developments.
Create a strategy:
What kind of content will you be displaying on your website? Content is basically anything that gives your visitors information. It can include: Blog posts, Documents, Video,Pictures (such as in a gallery), Slideshows.
Structure your website:

Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one. Most websites have an About and Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.
Start designing:
The importance of good web design can’t be stressed enough. Good website design includes both usability and aesthetics. An ugly website will drive away visitors, as will a website that’s difficult to navigate. 
 
Test it out:
Testing is important for finding out bugs out and catching details that you might have missed initially. Make sure your website shows up the way you want it to in all browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and mobile web browsers like Safari and Opera Mini. Test it on your cell phone, your tablet, and your colleague’s cell phones and tablets too. You want your site to have a consistent appearance no matter what screen it shows up on. Make sure all of the links work, that the images are properly sized, and that you’ve replaced all of the placeholders with actual content. See to it that all of the forms and other input fields are working.
Maintain the site:
A website is an ongoing entity that continuously represents your company, so maintenance is very important. Monitor your analytics software to see how your website is performing with the public. Keep an eye on metrics like your number of unique visitors, bounce rate, and which pages are most popular on your website. You might find that certain metrics are more useful to you than others, but that is information you will find out over time.
1.4 Most organizations have experienced projects that did not end on time, were over budget, or changed in scope over time. There are many pitfalls that can sink projects. Here we will focus on four basic reasons why projects fail. Because most project teams are comprised of at least three sets of players including executive management, project managers, and team members or resources, we will take a look at each issue from all three vantage points, and then provide suggested solutions.
1.5 Choosing the right information technology (IT) system to suit your business is an important decision. IT provides a foundation for the running of most modern businesses. It is necessary  to be carful when choosing new IT system. Some of the key things you will have to consider when choosing any IT product are:
functionality
compatibility
skills and support required
ability to scale up
integration
security
management and reporting capabilities
1.6 Trello is a system of boards, lists and cards. This creates a system that allows for individuals or teams to track a project and collaborate or contribute where they can be most useful or where it is most needed.Trello is a task management app that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on and who is working on it.
GitHub is built on open-end revisions to it, and share their new version. This creates a (positive) endless loop in which developer after developer downloads, updates, and shares code.
source principles, it’s as much a place for sharing code as it is a tool for storing it. This makes GitHub a highly collaborative environment. Developers are free to download a piece of software, make updates and add comments.
1.7 One of the primary objectives of GDPR is adjusting the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of personal data to better fit the challenges of technological development and globalization which have facilitated the unprecedented availability and pervasive use of personal data. Just to be clear, by personal data it means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
