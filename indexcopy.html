       <h2> Unit 1, Outcome 1</h2>

        <p>1.0 Before I moved to England I used to work in computer fields, mostly hardwares and repairing PC. When I moved here, I studied Computer Networking(Cisco CCNA,Level 3)In Manchester College but because of my immigration state I couldnâ€™t continue my study or even work in that field. When I saw an advertisement about Code Nation and job opportunities here I decided to come along and try myself to learn new skills as always been interested in. The subjects are teaching here all up to date and in demand these days as tech technology moving fast.

The reasons for the wide use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the business world.
